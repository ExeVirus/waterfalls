![ScreenShot](/Screenshot_2.jpg)

Depends on: [Unified Inventory](https://github.com/minetest-mods/unified_inventory), [Titanium](https://gitlab.com/VanessaE/titanium), Quartz, and Moreores

*Adds following Nodes:*

**Waterfall Block:**
  A block that spawns particles in a defined direction that fall a defined height. Can be adjusted with right click
  Can swim through, but will drown
 
**Waterfall Basin:**
  A block for placing at the bottom of a given waterfall, spawns particles that rebound from the ground in a defined direction and       
  height. Can be ajusted with right click. Not water, nor can you drown. May be changed in future

**Fountain:**
  A Beautiful Fountain with a simple particle animation, non-adjustable.

**Whirlpool Machine:**
  A furnace-like node that allows a user to input a bucket of water and a quartz crystal. Then after pulling a lever, the device  
  runs for 10 seconds, outputing a turbulent water bucket.
  
*Adds following items:*

**Turbulent Water Bucket:**
  A crafting item used for making the three active nodes of this mod. Does not make a new liquid type (yet).
